🤖 MITRA – Friendly Rule-Based Python Chatbot

MITRA is a beginner-friendly, rule-based AI chatbot built using Python.
It interacts with users through simple text commands, provides motivational responses, basic information (date/time), and demonstrates how conversational logic works using core Python concepts.
This project is designed to help beginners understand how chatbots work internally, while also focusing on clean structure, user interaction, and real-world usability.

📌 Problem Statement
Many beginners struggle to understand how chatbots actually work behind the scenes.
Common challenges:
•	No clarity on chatbot logic
•	Confusion between AI and rule-based systems
•	Difficulty handling user input properly
•	Lack of beginner-level, structured chatbot projects
MITRA solves this by providing a simple, readable, and interactive chatbot built entirely with core Python, without using any external AI libraries.
